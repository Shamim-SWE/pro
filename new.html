    <p>The importance of the test plan is to show how the system is to be tested and gives precise procedure 
        to be followed during test plan. The test data is identified, what is being tested and the expected 
        outcome as well as actual input. Test plan is one of the standard documents that should be produced 
        in most software engineering projects. If the project does not have any test plan this means that, the 
        system produced is low quality. This may not be acceptable to the user it will not satisfy their needs. 
        The test plan should be written as soon as requirements have been identified. The system will be 
        tested with sample data to see how it would handle input and output functions as well as extreme data 
        or conditions to determine the system behavior in overloaded situation, which will directly slow the 
        system that behaves in failure, or extreme situation.
